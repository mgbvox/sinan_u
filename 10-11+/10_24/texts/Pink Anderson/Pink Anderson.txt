Pinkney "Pink" Anderson (February 12, 1900 – October 12, 1974)[1] was an American blues singer and guitarist.
Anderson was born in Laurens, South Carolina, and raised in nearby Greenville and Spartanburg. He joined Dr. William R. Kerr of the Indian Remedy Company in 1914 to entertain the crowds, while Kerr tried to sell a concoction purported to have medicinal qualities.[2] He also toured with Leo "Chief Thundercloud" Kahdot and his medicine show, often with the harmonica player Arthur "Peg Leg Sam" Jackson, who was based in Jonesville, South Carolina.
Anderson was recorded by the folklorist Paul Clayton at the Virginia State Fair in May 1950.
He recorded an album in the early 1960s and performed at some live venues.[3] He appeared in the 1963 film The Bluesmen. He reduced his activities in the late 1960s after a stroke.[4] Attempts by the folklorist Peter B. Lowry to record Anderson in 1970 were not successful, although apparently he could occasionally summon up some of his past abilities. A final tour took place in the early 1970s with the aid of Roy Book Binder, one of his "students", taking him to Boston and New York.
He died in October 1974 of a heart attack, at the age of 74. He is interred at Lincoln Memorial Gardens, in Spartanburg.[1]
Anderson's son, known as Little Pink Anderson (born July 13, 1954),[5] is a bluesman living in Vermillion, South Dakota.[6]
Syd Barrett, of English progressive rock band Pink Floyd, created the band's name by juxtaposing the first names of Anderson and North Carolina bluesman Floyd Council,[3] having noticed the names in the liner notes of a 1962 album by Blind Boy Fuller (Philips BBL-7512), written by the blues historian Paul Oliver: "Curley Weaver and Fred McMullen, ... Pink Anderson or Floyd Council—these were a few amongst the many blues singers that were to be heard in the rolling hills of the Piedmont, or meandering with the streams through the wooded valleys."
