Kelly was born and raised in Streatham, South London, England on 5 January 1944.[1][2] Her early interest in playing grew out of hearing the Everly Brothers, Elvis Presley, Little Richard and Skiffle in the late 1950s.[2][3][4] She started playing guitar when she was 14 after learning a few chords from her younger brother, Dave Kelly.[2]
She appeared on several compilation albums with her first in 1966 being New Sounds In Folk and then two years later on Blues Anytime Vol. 1: An Anthology Of British Blues (1968) Immediate Records before releasing her first solo album titled Jo-Ann Kelly (1969), this was issued on CBS in the UK and Epic Records in the US.  She was also a core member of Tramp (band) along with her brother Dave Kelly.
