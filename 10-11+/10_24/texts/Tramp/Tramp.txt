Tramp were a British blues band, active during the late 1960s and early 1970s on an intermittent basis.[1]  This on/off activity and the loose, transient nature of the band's line-up were reflected in the group's name.
The line-up centred on the brother-sister pairing of Dave Kelly and Jo Ann Kelly, and included various members of Fleetwood Mac, plus various session musicians.[2]  The band released two albums; Tramp in 1969, and Put A Record On in 1974.[3]  All members participated in many other projects before, after and even during their time with Tramp.
