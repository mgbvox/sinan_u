The Tottenham Bluegrass Festival is an annual event which has been held in the community of Tottenham, Ontario since 1983.[1][2]
The Tottenham Bluegrass Festival presents a three-day stage show featuring well-known bluegrass bands from around Canada and the United States.[3][4][5][6]
In addition to the main stage entertainment, the festival also includes a children's talent show,[7] instrument-specific workshops, new band showcases, an artisan's village, a barbeque supper, and campfire picking.[4]
Contributing to the 30-year success of this festival is its location, the Tottenham Conservation Area, with shady camping for hundreds of trailers and tents and a natural amphitheatre overlooking a small lake.[8][9]
