Melvin "Lil' Son" Jackson (August 16, 1915, Tyler, Texas â€“ May 30, 1976, Dallas[1]) was an American blues guitarist. He was a contemporary of Lightnin' Hopkins.[2]
Jackson's mother played gospel guitar, and he played early on in a gospel group, the Blue Eagle Four.[1] He became a mechanic and served in the Army during World War II, after which he pursued a career as a blues musician[1] He recorded a demo and sent it to Bill Quinn, the owner of Gold Star Records, in 1946.[2] Quinn signed him to a recording contract and released "Freedom Train Blues" in 1948, which became a nationwide hit in the United States.[1] Jackson recorded for Imperial Records between 1950 and 1954, both as a solo artist and with a backing band.[1] His 1950 song "Rockin' and Rollin" was recast by later musicians as "Rock Me Baby".[1][3]
Jackson was injured in a car crash in the mid-1950s and gave up his music career, returning to work as a mechanic.[2] He recorded an LP released by Arhoolie Records in 1960 but did not resume his career as a musician during the blues revival in the 1960s.[2] He died of cancer in 1976 in Dallas, at the age of 60.[1][4]
