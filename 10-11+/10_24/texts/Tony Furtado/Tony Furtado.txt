Tony Furtado (born October 18, 1967) is an American singer-songwriter, banjoist, and guitarist.
Furtado was born in Pleasanton, California. He was interested in music and the banjo from an early age. He studied music and art at California State, Hayward. During college, he won the Grand National Banjo Championship in Kansas. Then he toured with bluegrass musician Laurie Lewis. Rounder Records released his debut album, Swamped, in 1989.[1][2]
Furtado played with Béla Fleck and Earl Scruggs. His second album, Within Reach (1992), featured bluegrass veterans Alison Krauss and Jerry Douglas. Comparisons to Ry Cooder were rooted in Furtado's combination of jazz, Celtic, and old-time music. On his third album, Full Circle (1994) he concentrated on acoustic blues and slide guitar, with Cooder as an influence. He recorded a duet album with Dirk Powell.[1] His band Sugarbeat also featured Ben Demerath (vocals, guitar), Matt Flinner (mandolin), and Sally Truitt (bass).[3]
"Furtado mixes Americana, folk, indie-rock, blues, and jazz styles."[4]
"As a banjo virtuoso, Furtado is well-known for his envelope-pushing, progressive bluegrass stylings. His picking is rapid-fire quick, sharp and clear, and puts him in the school of Béla Fleck and David Grisman."[5]
"He mixes bluegrass roots with a mainstream pop streak, easily holding the spotlight, thanks to his restrained virtuosity on acoustic and slide guitar and a warmly engaging voice reminiscent of T Bone Burnett, sans preachiness. – Paste magazine
