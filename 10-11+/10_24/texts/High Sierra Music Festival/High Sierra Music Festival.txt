High Sierra Music Festival is a multi-day music festival held in Quincy, California, United States, a mountainous area about 80 miles northwest of Reno, Nevada.
The festival is held each year the weekend of July 4.  The four-day festival features an eclectic mix of some of the most famous national and international names in jamband, newgrass and funk. Other represented genres include bluegrass, roots rock, electronica, reggae, jazz and afrobeat. Away from the music stages, patrons can attend films and movement playshops - yoga, pilates, etc., shop for arts and crafts, or enjoy a wide variety of gourmet food and drink. It's a family friendly and community oriented event with an expanding Family Area full of activities and certified nannies available throughout the weekend.
