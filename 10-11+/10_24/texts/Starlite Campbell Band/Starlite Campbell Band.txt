Starlite Campbell Band is a British blues group based between the Isle of Man and Germany. Formed in 2016, the band is led by married couple Suzy Starlite and Simon Campbell. Their debut album, Blueberry Pie was nominated for a European Blues Award in November 2017 and blends British blues, blues and Americana.
The duo had been recording, playing and touring independently in bands for many years until they met in 2012, when Starlite asked Campbell, who was British Blues Awards Nominee,[1] to join her band as the guitar player. The love extended past each other's playing and the duo were wed in 2014 after a whirlwind romance, forming their new joint band, Starlite Campbell, in January 2016.
As prolific singer-songwriters, they started writing together immediately and built up a large collection of songs in a variety of styles, from Americana, folk music, electronic music, progressive rock to British blues. The art of the song is everything and they fly in the face of disposable music â€“ writing, recording and producing their work and then releasing on their independent label Supertone Records.
Their first recorded collaboration was on Campbell's second solo album, The Knife[2] where they jointly wrote and performed Do You Want Me with Campbell on acoustic guitar, Theremin and vocals and Starlite on Mellotron and vocals.
The couple wrote the material for their debut album Blueberry Pie over two weeks in April 2016 and started recording in July at the Supertone Records Studio[3] in Valencia, Spain with the album mixed and mastered in October 2016. It was Produced and Engineered by Campbell, co-produced by Starlite and mastered by Jon Astley[4] who is known for his work with the Who and other rock luminaries. In addition to the band and session musicians Steve Gibson and Jonny Henderson, Valencian native Danny Boy Sanchez was co opted to play harmonica on track No. 5, "Say What You Want".
The album artwork is based on a picture taken by Starlite in the late 70's of her Grandmother Betty Higgs.[5]
Blueberry Pie was released on 1 February 2017[4] and has been extensively reviewed[6] by publications in the UK, Europe, USA and Australia Blues Matters!, R2 (Rock'n'Reel), Classic Rock[7]
The band made a festive release It Started Raining on 24 December 2017. The song was recorded live at Supertone Records studio in Valencia, Spain as part of the 'Blueberry Pie' sessions with a single guitar overdub. The cover image was taken by Isle of Man based photographer Phil Kneen and features an old caravan featured in the song's lyric.
On 12 November 2018 the band simultaneously released their new single Heart of Stone along with a limited edition, gatefold, 180g double phonograph record (vinyl) of their album Blueberry Pie. The lacquers were cut by Miles Showell[4] at Abbey Road Studios and the pressing supported by the Isle of Man Arts Council.[8]
Recorded as part of the original Blueberry Pie sessions, the track has a stinging, acidic lyric which complements the hypnotic rolling groove of the track. It appears exclusively in physical form on side four of the record. The cover image was taken by Isle of Man based photographer Phil Kneen featuring actor Rob Smith.
In May 2019 Starlite and Campbell relocated their Supertone Records studio into the countryside near Hannover, Germany where they will record their second album, The Language of Curiosity with a planned release in the spring of 2020.
During 2017 and 2018, the band performed extensively throughout Spain and the Isle of Man; in July 2018 band played Linton Festival[9][10][11] to great reviews.[12]
