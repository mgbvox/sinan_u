Claire Lynch is an American bluegrass musician, singer, songwriter, and producer. She is a three-time winner of the International Bluegrass Music Association's Female Vocalist of the Year honors.[3] She is considered one of the two best female voices in bluegrass, a recognition she shares with Dale Ann Bradley.[3]
Lynch moved to Huntsville, Alabama from Kingston, New York when she was 12 years old.[4] She grew up in a musical family, with her mother playing the piano and her father singing.[5] She had two sisters with whom she would sing, including doing trios at church. In high school, she spent time writing and recording songs.[5]
Lynch's musical career transitioned during college when she became interested in bluegrass music. She joined a band called Hickory Wind, which eventually changed its name to the Front Porch String Band.[5] Lynch played with the group until 1981, when it retired from the road. She then pursued a dual career of music and raising a family. The Front Porch String Band reunited in 1991, releasing the album Lines and Traces.[5]
Lynch has won numerous awards in her career, including being named the best female vocalist in 1997, 2010, and 2013 by the International Bluegrass Music Association. She also received a USA Walker Fellowship Award in 2012.[7]
Lynch's 1995 album Moonlighter was nominated for Best Bluegrass Album at the 38th Annual Grammy Awards, and her 2016 album North By South was nominated for the same award at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.
