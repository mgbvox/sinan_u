William Keith Relf (22 March 1943 – 14 May 1976) was an English musician, best known as the lead vocalist and harmonica player for the Yardbirds.
Relf started playing in bands around the summer of 1956 as a singer, guitarist, and harmonica player. His blues harp was a key part of the Yardbirds' sound and success, according to many, and his vocals may have been as important a contribution to the band,[1] as that of their three lead guitarists Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Page—who were augmented by bassist Paul Samwell-Smith, guitarist/bassist Chris Dreja, and drummer Jim McCarty.
Relf co-wrote many of the original Yardbirds songs ("Shapes of Things", "I Ain't Done Wrong", "Over Under Sideways Down", "Happenings Ten Years Time Ago"), later showing a leaning towards acoustic/folk music as the sixties unfolded ("Only the Black Rose").[2] He also sang an early version of "Dazed and Confused" in live Yardbirds concerts, a song later recorded by the band's successor group Led Zeppelin.[3]
His debut solo single, "Mr. Zero", peaked at No. 50 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1966.[4]
After the Yardbirds broke up in July 1968, Relf formed the acoustic duo Together, with fellow Yardbird Jim McCarty, followed immediately by Renaissance (which also featured his sister Jane Relf).[5] After leaving Renaissance in 1970, he started producing other artists: Steamhammer, folk-rock band Hunter Muskett, the acoustic world music group Amber, psychedelic band Saturnalia,[6] and blues-rock band Medicine Head (with whom he also played bass guitar).[7] In 1974, he formed progressive/rock group Armageddon. Their self-titled debut, Armageddon, was recorded in England and released in the United States on A&M Records. The album's original liner notes used the term "supergroup"; their personnel (besides Relf) included drummer Bobby Caldwell (previously a member of Captain Beyond and Johnny Winter's band), guitarist Martin Pugh (from Steamhammer, The Rod Stewart Album, and later of 7th Order),[8] and bassist Louis Cennamo (also formerly of Renaissance and Steamhammer).[9]
In 1966, he married April Liversidge.  They had two sons, Danny and Jason.[10]
Relf died in the basement of his home in 1976 at age 33 from electrocution while playing an electric guitar. Relf had several health problems throughout his life, including emphysema and asthma, which may have contributed to his inability to survive the electric shock.[11] (A common rumor at the time was that Relf had been playing guitar in the bathtub, but this isn't true.) 
At the time, it is said that Relf was in the process of putting back together the original Renaissance line-up, which would eventually be called Illusion.[12] He was buried in Richmond Cemetery.[13]
Relf's posthumous 1992 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction with the Yardbirds was represented by his widow April, and sons Danny and Jay.[14]
Most of Relf's recordings were released under the name of the group he was in at the time. However, an early attempt was made to establish him as a solo musician and two singles came out under his own name in 1966.[15]
A further single appeared in 1989:
