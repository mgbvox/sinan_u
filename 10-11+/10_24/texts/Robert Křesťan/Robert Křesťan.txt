Druhá Tráva ("Second Grass" in Czech) is a Czech bluegrass band from the Czech Republic, formed in 1991 by Robert Křesťan and Luboš Malina. As of August 2005, they have released eighteen studio albums either as a group or as side projects.
They, along with much of Central Europe were inspired by Pete Seeger's tour there in 1964.[1] Bluegrass music had existed in the Czech Republic since the mid-1960s. Along with American folk music, it was popular among many of the students involved in the Prague Spring in 1968. These events led to the interesting situation that bluegrass and folk music was considered politically subversive by some of the Communist elite.
Along with Křesťan (lead vocals, guitar), the original line-up consisted of Luboš Malina (banjo), Jiří Meisner (bass guitar), Pavel Malina (guitar), and Luboš Novotný (dobro). Martin Ledvina (guitar) replaced Pavel Malina in 1997. In 2004, the line-up changed considerably, with Jiří Meisner and Martin Ledvina leaving the group and Petr Surý (bass) and Emil Formánek (guitar, mandolin and harmony vocals) joining.
Druhá Tráva are commonly compared to their bluegrass and folk forerunners such as Ricky Skaggs, Peter Rowan, Davy Spillane, and Béla Fleck as well. The band recently signed to Compass Records. On Compass they released their sixth studio album, Czechmate[permanent dead link], and an album with Peter Rowan, New Freedom Bell[permanent dead link]. In September 2004 they released an all-acoustic album entirely with English lyrics, Good Morning Friend, which was released in Czech Republic on the Universal label.
