Paul Hébert (born July 26, 1971) is one of the rare francophone references in the bluegrass idiom which has been predominantly English. In 2007, the “L'Acadie Nouvelle” newspaper dubbed him “Le Roi du Bluegrass” or “The King of Bluegrass”.
Paul Hébert was born into a musical family in Rogersville, New Brunswick, halfway between the Acadian Peninsula and Moncton. He first learned guitar which quickly became his preferred instrument, playing mostly traditional music. He later learned and mastered the mandolin which often becomes his main instrument on stage.
Paul Hébert has been a regular guest  on the TV show Pour l’amour du country broadcast on the waves of Radio-Canada, TV5 and ARTV.  He is also one of the most demanded back up vocalist in Acadie.
