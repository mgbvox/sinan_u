Watashi Wa was a Christian pop rock band from San Luis Obispo, California on Tooth & Nail Records.  "Watashi wa" (私は) in Japanese  means "me".[1] (It was previously indicated that "Watashi wa" means "[as for] me" in Japanese. This is incorrect. That would be translated as "Watashi to shite wa" [私としては].)
The band formed in 2000 when most of the members were still in their teens. They were first signed to indie label Bettie Rocket and released two albums before signing to Tooth & Nail in 2002. 
The band broke up in July 2004, but in a deal with Tooth & Nail Records singer/guitarist Seth Roberts' new band Eager Seas, were signed to the same label and released their first album under the name Watashi Wa. They subsequently left the label.[2]
The new band currently plays under the name "Lakes" and have signed with The Militia Group and released the Photographs EP.[3]
Both Roger Tompkins and Lane Biermann played their respective instruments in the alt country band Briertone, but have since moved on to pursue other things.
