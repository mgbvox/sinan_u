Haste the Day is an American metalcore band formed in Carmel, Indiana in 2001 and signed to Solid State Records. Their name is derived from a lyric in the hymn "It Is Well with My Soul" by Horatio Spafford.

Haste the Day formed in 2001 in Carmel, Indiana.  The name was discovered by Devin Chaulk who read it from the hymn "It Is Well with My Soul." The band originally started out as a three-piece including: Brennan Chaulk (guitar/vocals), Devin Chaulk (drums/vocals), and Mike Murphy (bass/vocals).  Six months after forming, the band added longtime friend Jason Barnes to the group as a second guitarist.  In 2002, the band recruited Jimmy Ryan as their lead vocalist who was member of the death metal band Upheaval from 1997 until 1999.[1] In the summer of 2002, the band self-produced their first EP, That They May Know You with the song "Substance" acting as the lead single. A year later Haste the Day signed with Tooth & Nail Records subsidiary Solid State Records.
After signing to Solid State, Haste the Day went on to record their debut album, Burning Bridges which was released on March 9, 2004 in the band's old high school cafeteria at Carmel High School.  The band made two music videos for the songs "The Closest Thing To Closure" and "American Love". After a year, Haste the Day released When Everything Falls.  The album hit stores on June 28, 2005.
