City of Caterpillar is an American post-hardcore band from Richmond, Virginia, formed in 2000. They released a split with Pg. 99, one studio album, and a full-length compilation of demos and live tracks. Their songs, some of which are over 8 minutes long, are often characterized by melodic post-rock passages building up into chaotic outbursts.[2]
The band broke up in late 2003, but announced a string of reunion shows across the east coast of the United States in 2016.[3] News of the bands reunion came after Repeater Records reissued their self-titled album.[4][5] The band also announced a European tour for the summer of 2017 and a Japanese tour in the summer of 2018.[6][7]
City of Caterpillar shared band members with Pg. 99, Darkest Hour, Stop It!!, Enemy Soil, Kilara, Monotonashhfuck, and later Majority Rule. They broke up in December 2003, with Jeff and Kevin going on to join Haram as well as forming the bands Malady and Verse En Coma (the latter also featuring Ryan Parrish), and Brandon and Pat forming Ghastly City Sleep.
