Hellogoodbye (sometimes styled as hellogoodbye) is a pop rock band that was formed in Huntington Beach, California in 2001 by singer Forrest Kline. They were signed to Drive-Thru Records and released their first full-length album Zombies! Aliens! Vampires! Dinosaurs! in 2006, in addition to their previously released EP Hellogoodbye and DVD OMG HGB DVD ROTFL. In 2010, the band released Would It Kill You? on their label Wasted Summer Records. The album was released in the United Kingdom and Europe by LAB Records on the 14 March 2011. Hellogoodbye released their third album, Everything Is Debatable, on October 29, 2013, while touring as the opening act for Paramore's The Self-Titled Tour. Their fourth album, S'Only Natural, was released on October 5, 2018.
Hellogoodbye started in 2001 as a recording project by Huntington Beach High School students Forrest Kline and Jesse Kurvink. With the interest only to entertain friends and woo crushes, Kline and Kurvink recorded some songs on Forrest's home computer. The first Hellogoodbye song ever written was Kurvink's "Bonnie Taylor Shakedown 2K1" which later appeared on their debut self-titled EP. With Kline's interest in web and graphic design, the unofficial group got a working title and a website and posted songs on MP3.com. As interest in the music grew, Kline recruited friends and chanced upon some opening slots at local shows.
In the first two years the group played local shows in Orange County at venues such as the Chain Reaction (Anaheim, California), The Hub (Fullerton, California), and Koo's Cafe (Long Beach, California), made a few trips to play in Arizona, and did one mini-tour through Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas with the band Peachcake. During this time they kept busy burning demos, screen printing tee-shirts and promoting via their website before signing to Drive-Thru Records in 2003.
The lineup went through a few changes before signing to Drive-Thru. Parker Case, now of Say Anything, started out playing drums, but was replaced in 2001 by Aaron Flora (of the band XThrowDownX). A high school friend named Paul White was the original bassist, but he quit and was replaced by Marcus Cole in 2002. After signing to Drive-Thru Records, Flora left to go to college and was replaced by drummer Chris Profeta. In 2007, Cole left the band and was replaced by long-time buddy Travis Head.
After signing in 2003 Hellogoodbye released a self-titled EP on August 17, 2004, which has sold over 400,000 copies to date. The band began touring vigorously in support of this release in the United States and abroad. During the "Sounds of Change Tour" with An Angle, Socratic, and Steel Train, Hellogoodbye flipped and totaled their van and trailer after Cole dozed off behind the wheel while driving through Pennsylvania on October 22, 2004. None of the band's members were injured.
While participating in the 2005 South by Southwest (SXSW), a music festival in Austin, Texas, the band appeared on several episodes of MTV's The Real World: Austin. The cast of the TV series produced a video documentary about three bands on the festival's line-up (the other two were Halifax and Enon), including interviews and live footage. The appearance gave a boost to the band's popularity.
On November 22, 2005 Hellogoodbye released a DVD titled OMG HGB DVD ROTFL. It featured two hours of concert and touring footage, as well as music videos to the five songs off their debut EP. Following the release, the group was featured on the third and fourth installments of the Drive-Thru Records DVD series. In December 2005, the band won MTV2's Dew Circuit Breakout.
On August 8, 2006, after two years of touring, Hellogoodbye released its first full-length record, Zombies! Aliens! Vampires! Dinosaurs! produced by SOPHIE through Drive-Thru Records. In 2006, Hellogoodbye appeared on the Vans Warped Tour, did a full headlining tour with Reggie and the Full Effect, Cute Is What We Aim For, Ozma and Peachcake, visited the United Kingdom (with The Plain White T's), Japan, and Europe. In 2007, they continued touring, doing a headlining tour with Boys Like Girls, a tour of Australia with Australian band The Lucksmiths, played the main stage of The Bamboozle in New Jersey, headlined the side stage at Give It a Name, played the Reading and Leeds Festivals in the United Kingdom as well as fellow European festivals Pukklelpop, Rock en Seine, and the MySpace Music Tour (co-headlining with Say Anything).
In the January 2007 issue of Alternative Press, the group confirmed their new album would be released 2008. In January 2007, the single "Here (In Your Arms)" saw a resurgence on Top 40 radio and entered the Billboard Hot 100 (peaking at No. 14) and the Pop 100 (peaking at No. 9).[2] The song was certified platinum in the United States. "Here (In Your Arms)" peaked within the top ten of the charts in the Republic of Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The song saw its biggest success in the former country, where it peaked at number two on the Irish Singles Chart in May 2007. In the same month, they also appeared on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and Last Call with Carson Daly. Their song "Oh, It is Love" became the theme song on MTV's Engaged and Underage. On March 13, 2007 they released an iTunes exclusive three-song EP, which features three different remixes of the song "All of Your Love." A few months later that year, the MTV movie Super Sweet 16 aired on television, featuring a live performance by Hellogoodbye of their song "All of Your Love."
In September 2008, it was announced that keyboardist Jesse Kurvink would be leaving the band to finish college. Replacing him would be Joe Marro, former guitarist/keyboardist of The Early November. In addition to the lineup changes, the band has announced a fall tour throughout the United States. Accompanying them on the tour are Never Shout Never, Say No More, Ace Enders, and PlayRadioPlay!.[3] In October 2008, it was announced on hellogoodbye's blog that drummer Chris Profeta would be leaving the band, and will be replaced by former Hellogoodbye drummer Aaron Flora.
On various websites during 2009 and 2010, including their own, Hellogoodbye stated they were working on a new record.[4][5] The name of the album was revealed to be Would It Kill You?. The band paired up to tour with Hanson, starting on September 30 in Tulsa followed by dates in October and early November on what is called the Use Your Sole Tour.[6] Other bands which partook in the tour were Steel Train and Sherwood. On August 5, 2009, Hellogoodbye did a live stream of their new song "When We First Met" on absolutepunk.net.[citation needed]
Hellogoodbye was selected to perform at Boston's notorious CollegeFest event on September 26, 2009.
In late 2009, the band began to post new covers on their website, including a cover of "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" (originally by John Lennon) and "Do You Want to Know a Secret" (originally by The Beatles). Kline then said that some of the covers will be of '90s emo and mid '80s punk.
In early 2010, they went on tour with New Found Glory, Saves the Day, and Fireworks.
According to their Twitter on February 25, 2010, they officially parted ways with Drive-Thru Records. This ended an over year-long lawsuit with the label which hindered a new album release which had already been written and recorded. Future releases will now be through their own label, Wasted Summer. The band is also running their own online merchandise store at hellagoodbuys.net. The new merchandise also features some homemade items from family and friends.[7]
A track from Hellogoodbye's second album Would It Kill You? was announced via their website, and was revealed to be called "Getting Old". At a concert on September 10, 2010 Hellogoodbye performed two new tracks entitled "Coppertone" and "When We First Kissed". Would It Kill You? was released on November 9, 2010.
On the Vans Warped Tour 2011, Hellogoodbye was filmed by Chris Skiles and interviewed by Juliet Simms. Forrest spoke about being a vegan on tour for Buzznet's Incredibly Green on the Go segment.[8]
Would It Kill You? was released on March 14, 2011 in the United Kingdom and European Union by LAB Records.[9]
On January 25, 2012, it was announced that Joe Marro was leaving the band. He cited his recent marriage and touring pressures as the reason for the split. He was replaced by Augie Rampolla (ex-You, Me, and Everyone We Know guitarist).[10]
