Jamie Hartford is an American singer, musician, and songwriter.
Jamie, the son of John Hartford, was raised in a musical environment, meeting and learning from artists such as Johnny Cash, the Everly Brothers, Cowboy Jack Clement, and John Prine.[1]
In his early career, Hartford occasionally filled in for Albert Lee at Everly Brothers performances. He also performed with the re-formed Amazing Rhythm Aces.[2]
In the mid-90s, Hartford was signed by Asylum Records and recorded an album with producer Pete Anderson. This album was never released.[3]
In 1997, Paladin Records released Hartford's album What About Yes. He was assisted by Pat McLaughlin (guitar), Jeff "Stick" Davis (bass), and Jim Lauderdale.[3][4]
Hartford paid homage to his father by recording an album with him (Hartford & Hartford) and recorded an album of John's songs (Part Of Your History: The Songs Of John Hartford).[5]
The Jamie Hartford Band includes Ray Flacke (guitar), Rick Lonow (drums), Paco Ship (harmonica), and Charlie Chadwick (bass).[6]
The late singer-songwriter Guy Clark, who built 19th-century-style flamenco guitars, made a gift of one to Hartford.[7]
