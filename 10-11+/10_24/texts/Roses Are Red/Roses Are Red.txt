Roses Are Red (originally called Nobody Cares[5]) was a rock band formed in Rochester, New York.[6][7] The band was signed to Trustkill Records.[8]
Roses Are Red formed in the summer of 2002 from members of other bands around the Western New York area.[9] It originally featured Vincent Minervino[10][11][12] on vocals, Brian and Matthew Gordner[13][14][15][16] on guitars, Kevin Mahoney[17][18][19] on bass, and Michael Lasaponara[20][21][22] on drums. Just 2 months after forming, the band recorded a 4-song demo and toured on weekends throughout the fall and winter of 2002. Their first full-length album, Handshakes and Heartbreaks, was released in June 2003 and was followed by a tour of the United States in July and August 2003. The band was named "The Next Big Thing" by Absolutepunk.net, and label interest soon followed. In the spring of 2004, Roses Are Red signed with New Jersey-based indie label Trustkill Records.[23][24]
After select dates on the 2004 Warped Tour,[25] the band released Conversations in the fall of 2004. The album was produced by Chris Badami (The Early November, The Starting Line). The band toured in support of Conversations, supporting The Plain White T's, Underoath, Silverstein, Matchbook Romance, Chiodos and Hawthorne Heights. RAR returned to the Warped Tour in 2005,[26] playing alongside Boys Night Out, Armor For Sleep, From First To Last and Emery.
In March 2005, while touring with A Thorn For Every Heart, Kevin Mahoney left the band and was replaced by Brad Gilboe, from Detroit. Mahoney began playing guitar for Polar Bear Club.[27] In 2006, he would re-join the band to record and release their second album, but left shortly after and was replaced by Andy Champion. Both Matthew and Brian Gordner left the band in late 2005. Shaun Murphy joined the band shortly after and was followed by Tom Zenns.
Roses Are Red spent the early part of 2006 writing and recording their second album, What Became Of Me, which was released in June 2006 and was one of Alternative Press Magazine's 'Most Anticipated Albums Of 2006'. The album was produced by Brian McTernan[28] (Thrice, Circa Survive, Darkest Hour, Senses Fail).
After the departure of Michael Lasaponara and Shaun Murphy in February 2007, just after the conclusion of the Glitz 'N Glamour tour (which they headlined and featured Rookie of the Year, Scenes From A Movie, and Four Letter Lie),[29] the band went on hiatus and ultimately disbanded.
Tom Zenns joined the band Time & Distance, but left shortly after. Andy Champion also joined T&D around the same time, playing bass, before leaving to join Zenns in his new project, Love or Lust. Champion eventually left LOL and briefly played in the Buffalo, NY-based band The Boy And His Machine.[30] Michael Lasaponara played drums in the California-based-band William Tell for a short while, appearing on Last Call with Carson Daly.[31] He then began doing drum tech work for bands such as The Used,[32] The Academy Is..., Armor For Sleep, Cobra Starship and Chiodos before playing drums in Cute Is What We Aim For[33] until their short-lived break-up in 2009. He is now with the New York band Nocturnal Me.[34] Brian Gordner is now a tour manager and has worked with Straylight Run and Augustana, while his brother Matthew is the General Manager of Portland-based indie label Rise Records. Kevin Mahoney now plays guitar in Hit The Lights[35] and a side project by the name of Holy War. Vincent Minervino was working on forming a new band called American Hearts, which later became My Island. Minervino left the project and played guitar in The Brigantines, a Surf-Pop band until switching to drums and joining the instrumental surf trio Black Flamingos, based out of Asbury Park, NJ.[36]
