The Promise Ring is an American rock band from Milwaukee, Wisconsin that are recognized as part of the second wave of emo[6][7].  Formed in 1995, they first split up in 2002 and have reunited occasionally since 2005. The band has released four full-length studio albums, plus various EPs and singles. 
The band was started in 1995 as a side project by Davey von Bohlen during his time as a guitarist/vocalist for Cap'n Jazz. Von Bohlen started the project alongside guitarist Jason Gnewikow of None Left Standing, drummer Dan Didier and bassist Scott Beschta, the latter two both being former members of Ceilishrine.[8]
The Promise Ring's first full-length album, titled 30Â° Everywhere, was released by Jade Tree Records in 1996. The record was followed by 1997's Nothing Feels Good, which gained the band a larger following and rave reviews. After the recording, but prior to the release of Nothing Feels Good, Tim Burton (ex-None Left Standing) replaced Scott Beschta.  The Horse Latitudes, which collected early tracks that were previously released as 7"s, was also released in 1997.  After another change in bass players, 1998 saw the release of the Boys and Girls EP, which was released on both compact disc and 7", with the CD containing an additional song. In 1999 they furthered their success with the release of Very Emergency, which concentrated even more on their pop sound. Following their final release in 2002, wood/water, which featured bassist Ryan Weber, The Promise Ring decided to move on to new projects, like Von Bohlen's and Didier's new band named Maritime.
The band reunited for the Flower 15 Festival in late November 2005 in Chicago, at Metro Chicago.
In mid-June 2009, a hidden webpage was discovered on the Anti website detailing an upcoming Promise Ring greatest hits compilation entitled, It's Not Brain Surgery: The Best Of. The page was subsequently removed and no official release information has yet surfaced about this posthumous compilation.
On November 18, 2011, The Promise Ring alluded to a second reunion via their Twitter, writing: "Hello again...".[9][10][11][12] Four days later, the band announced that they would be performing live on February 24, 2012 at Turner Hall in Milwaukee, which was followed by a Chicago date at the Metro on February 25.[13] Drummer Dan Didier said that there would likely be more shows. To coincide with the reunion, The Promise Ring announced they would be releasing a rarities collection in the summer of 2012 on former (and reunited) manager Jeff Castelaz's record label, Dangerbird Records.[14] As of October 2015, the collection has not been released.
On January 18, 2012, The Promise Ring announced they would perform at the 2012 Bamboozle Festival in Asbury Park, New Jersey with Foo Fighters, Blink-182, Jimmy Eat World, and others.[15]
The band played what seemed to have been their final reunion performance at the Fun Fun Fun Fest in Austin on November 4, 2012.
As of October 2015, The Promise Ring is active again, and they will play their first show in three years on New Year's Eve at the Metro in Chicago, where they will play their second album Nothing Feels Good in its entirety.[16] A few days prior to the announcement of the aforementioned show, The Promise Ring posted a picture on their Twitter account that said "Welcome to 2016", suggesting that some activity as The Promise Ring would take place in 2016.[17]
On August 14, 2016, The Promise Ring played the second Wrecking Ball festival in Atlanta. This event was the last to be held at  The Masquerade. Maritime also played the same day.[citation needed]
