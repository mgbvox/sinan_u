Dear Ephesus was an American Christian Alternative Rock music group from Orlando, Florida. They were voted third-favorite new group of 1997 by HM Magazine readers,[citation needed] and went on to release two albums. The band broke up at the end of the 1990s.
Several members re-formed as Tenderfoot, hoping to fill their Bulletproof Records contract and reach the secular market. They had one release under this name, The Devil And Rock And Roll, in 2000.[1]
