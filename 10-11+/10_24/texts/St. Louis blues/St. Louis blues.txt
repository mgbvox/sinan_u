St. Louis blues is a type of blues music. It is usually more piano-based than other forms of the blues and is closely related to jump blues, ragtime and piano blues. It is sometimes performed to a "Saint Louis shuffle" beat: a drum rhythm with heavy on-the-beat accents. A band performing St. Louis blues typically consists of one or more singers, a pianist and a few other musical instruments (used primarily for rhythm), but it is also common for a guitarist to take the lead, even to play parts normally played on piano.[1]
