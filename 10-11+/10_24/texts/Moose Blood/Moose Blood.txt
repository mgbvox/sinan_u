Moose Blood announced in January 2016 that they would be touring the UK throughout April 2016, supported by The Winter Passing and Greywind.[10] The tour - which would include headline shows at venues such as the O2 Academy Islington in London, and Joiners in Southampton - ended up selling out before it had begun.[11] Moose Blood announced, via their Facebook and Twitter accounts, on 13 April that they had signed to Hopeless Records for their second album.[12] On 17 April that the first single titled "Honey" was played on the Radio 1 Rock Show as the Rockest Record.

In March 2017, Moose Blood announced the departure of drummer Glenn Harvey in the wake of sexual harassment allegations.[14] Harvey was alleged to have sent an unsolicited image to a woman during 2015.[15]
On September 24, 2018, a few hours after being announced as support for Good Charlotte for their headline tour across Europe and the UK they released a statement saying that they "need to step away", hinting at a hiatus or a break up.[16]
Moose Blood has been described as emo,[4] pop punk[17] and emo pop.[18] Their 2013 EP Moving Home is "like a combination of Brand New's Deja Entendu, The Get Up Kids' Something to Write Home About and American Football's self-titled."[19]
