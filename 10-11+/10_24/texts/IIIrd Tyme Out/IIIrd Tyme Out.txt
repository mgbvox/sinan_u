Consisting of Russell Moore (lead vocals and guitar), Keith McKinnon (vocals and banjo), Nathan Aldridge (vocals and fiddle), Wayne Benson (vocals and mandolin) and Dustin Pyrtle (vocals and bass), the band has released thirteen albums and two greatest hits collections since 1991. A regular on bluegrass radio, their works have earned them many individual and group IBMA and SPBGMA award nominations including the prestigious IBMA Vocal Group of the Year award which they've won numerous times.[1]
In November 2013, banjo player Steve Dilling and bass player Edgar Loudermilk announced their intentions to leave IIIrd Tyme Out. Steve Dilling cited health reasons as his reason for leaving the band while Edgar Loudermilk decided to capitalize on a songwriting and solo CD push.[2] It was later announced that Keith McKinnon would be the new banjo player and Blake Johnson would be the new bass player.[3] The new lineup performed together on stage for the first time in January 2014 in Galax, Virginia.
