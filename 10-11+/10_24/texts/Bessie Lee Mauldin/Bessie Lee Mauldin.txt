Bessie Lee Mauldin (Bessie Lee "The Carolina Songbird" Mauldin; December 28, 1920 in Norwood, North Carolina – February 8, 1983) was an American bluegrass bassist just like her brother Isaac Mauldin.
She was the fifth of five children. Bessie first met Bill Monroe in 1938, and a few years later  went on to become his bass player with the Bluegrass Boys, from 1953–1964.[1] She played in many recording sessions of the band. Her love affair with Bill Monroe began around 1941 and carried on largely while Bill was touring with the Bluegrass Boys. In their years together she was his confidante and lover, and acted as a peacemaker.[2]
Monroe and Mauldin wrote a few songs together, one of which was a gospel song, A Voice From On High, which was performed by Bob Dylan as his opening number in August 2002.[3]
