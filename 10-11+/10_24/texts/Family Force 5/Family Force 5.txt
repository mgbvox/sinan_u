FF5 (formerly known as Family Force 5, The Phamily, Ground Noise and The Brothers) is an American Christian rock band from Atlanta, Georgia.[1] The band formed in 2005 by brothers Solomon "Soul Glow Activatur", Joshua "Fatty", and Jacob "Crouton" Olds along with their two friends, Nathan Currin "Nadaddy" and Brad Allen "20 Cent" later replaced by Derek Mount "Chapstique". The group has released five studio albums, nine EPs, and two remix albums. They are often noted for their raucous, party-centric personae and eclectic mix of genres, ranging from rap metal to dance-pop.
In 2018, the remaining two members, Jacob and Joshua Olds, re-branded the group as FF5 and released their EP, El Compadre, on March 2, 2018.[2]
Family Force 5 was formed in Atlanta, Georgia, under their original name, The Brothers. Three of the five original members, Solomon ("Soul Glow Activatur") and twins Joshua ("Fatty") and Jacob ("Crouton"),[3] are sons of Jerome Olds, a Christian artist popular in the late 1980s. The Brothers released Fact and Reality in 1994 and RPM in 1995. Both albums were released on Star Song Records and produced by their father.[4][5]
The group changed their name to "Ground Noise", which they classified as "a really bad version of Third Day."[6] Shortly after, the three brothers added Derek Mount ("Chap Stique") and Nathan "Nate" Currin ("Nadaddy"). They then re-named their group The Phamily.
A decade later, the band signed with Maverick Records, for distribution to the mainstream market before signing to Gotee Records for the Christian market. Under the name "The Phamily", the band sought a dual recording deal to better distribute their music to both the mainstream and Christian markets.[5] According to Solomon Olds, "To me, and pretty much anybody that's under my age, most Christian music is a turnoff. I don't want to be affiliated with that. I want to be affiliated with something that is great music. I feel that Maverick and Gotee together can pull that off."[4] The group was then forced to change their name again, due to copyright issues with Prince's band, The Family.[citation needed]
On March 21, 2006, the band released their first full-length album Business Up Front/Party in the Back under their new name "Family Force 5", which was an instant hit in both the Christian and mainstream markets spawning several hit singles such as "Love Addict" and "Earthquake". Both of these songs, like many others on the album, are heavily focused around the guitar. Their debut album has been both disparaged and praised by Christian and non-Christian critics respectively for not containing overtly Christian content in any of its tracks. In March 2007, their debut album was re-released as Business Up Front/Party in the Back: Diamond Edition, which contains three previously unreleased songs.[7]
During this time, Family Force 5 contributed the song "Mind's Eye" for the compilation album Freaked! A Gotee Tribute to DC Talk's Jesus Freak. For Christmas, Family Force 5 released a few Christmas-themed audio blogs. They also recorded "Grandma", a cover of "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer". Also a new unreleased song, "Whatcha Gonna Do with It", was added to the Hip Hope Hits: 2008 album.[8] Another previously unreleased song, "Master of Disguise", was posted on YouTube. However, due to mixed fan reaction to the song it was not slated for release at the time.
In June 2008, Family Force 5 released an EP entitled Dance or Die EP to debut three songs from their upcoming album Dance or Die. On August 19, 2008, the full-length album was released taking on a more club oriented, electronic dance sound than Business Up Front/Party in the Back with less guitar. The full-length album, Dance or Die, received a favorable review in World Magazine.[9]
Blake Soloman of AbsolutePunk.net had the following to say about the album; "Even though Family Force 5 may be the musical equivalent of mixing Mentos and Coke-–lots of build up for something that only ever happens one way-–I find myself oddly pleased with Dance or Die."
Dance or Die sold 17,000 copies in its first week and debuted at 30 on the Billboard 200. By the end of January, the album had sold over 50,000 units and during early 2009 the band embarked on the AP tour from March to May promoting the album and headlining concerts throughout the U.S.[10] In December 2008, the band won the Best Christian Rock Artist, Best Crunk Rock/Rap Artist and Best Rock Album for Dance or Die at the Rock on Request Awards.[11]
