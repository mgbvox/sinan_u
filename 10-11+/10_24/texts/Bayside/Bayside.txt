Bayside was formed by Anthony Raneri and Mike Kozak in October 2000[2] in Queens, New York City. The band got its name when on their way to a New Found Glory show on Long Island, with the intention of giving New Found Glory a demo CD, and they were trying to think of a name to write on the CD. They passed the Bayside train station, and decided to write "Bayside" on the CD simply as a name for New Found Glory, but the name became permanent.[3] The group self-released a 5-song demo and signed to Dying Wish Records to issue their first release, Long Stories Short EP in 2001. In 2003 the band released a split EP with Name Taken, entitled Bayside/Name Taken, with Dying Wish Records. Later in 2003, Bayside signed to Victory Records, where the band resided for the next six years. Bayside's debut full-length album, Sirens and Condolences, was released on January 27, 2004, through Victory Records.
The band's self-titled follow-up album, Bayside, was released on August 23, 2005, by Victory Records. While touring in support of the album, the band was involved in a van accident on October 31, 2005, at 3 AM in Cheyenne, Wyoming. After leaving their Boulder, Colorado show, their vehicle hit a patch of ice, skid off the road, and flipped over. Drummer John "Beatz" Holohan, age 31, was killed, and bassist Nick Ghanbarian was seriously injured when he was ejected through one of the van's windows. Ghanbarian broke his L-4 (lumbar vertebrae) which required surgery, while bandmates Anthony Raneri and Jack O'Shea escaped with minor injuries.[4][5]
Bayside released Acoustic, a collection of acoustic versions of their songs which featured the song "Winter", a tribute to Holohan. The band Punchline dedicated their album 37 Everywhere to the memory of Holohan. The first song on the record, "Flashlight," features backing vocals from Raneri, and the song "They Are Strong Hands" is a reference to Bayside's song "They Look Like Strong Hands" from their self-titled album. "They Are Strongs Hands" also makes a lyrical shout out to Holohan saying "Ain't no body gonna bring me down, 'cause my boy John Beatz got my back." Several other bands wrote songs dedicated to his memory, including Aiden, I Am the Avalanche, Silverstein, and The Sleeping.[6]
The band released The Walking Wounded on February 6, 2007, and was re-released as The Walking Wounded: Gold Edition on July 22, 2007, with the newer edition containing bonus live acoustic tracks as well as a bonus DVD, which includes live acoustic recordings, music videos, and documentaries. The drums and percussion on the album were performed by Chris Guglielmo, who joined the band as their new drummer after the death of John Holohan. A remix of the song "Duality" was featured in the soundtrack to Resident Evil: Extinction.
On September 30, 2008 the band released its fourth full-length album, Shudder, and a live album, Live at the Bayside Social Club. The album had been leaked onto various file-sharing sites earlier in the month on September 5, 2008.
