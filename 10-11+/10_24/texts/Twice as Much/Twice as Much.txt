Twice as Much was composed of Dave Skinner (born David Ferguson Skinner, 4 July 1946) and Andrew Rose (born Andrew Colin Campbell Rose, 12 March 1946, Edgware, Middlesex), harmony singers who wrote much of their own material.[1]
Their only UK Top 40 success as performers was a cover of the Mick Jagger/  Keith Richards composition "Sittin' on a Fence" (1966).[2] The Rolling Stones' version of the song, although recorded in December 1965, was not released on a Stones' album in the US until 1967 and not in the UK (where it again emerged as an album track) until 1969.
In 1972, Skinner joined Uncle Dog, a group including vocalist Carol Grimes. He penned most of the tracks on their album, Old Hat. He was also a member of Clancy. In 1977/8, Skinner toured as the keyboard player with Roxy Music. He also contributed to albums by Phil Manzanera and Bryan Ferry.[3]
