Chasing Victory is an American post-hardcore band
from Camilla, Georgia. The band was formed in 2001 by Adam Harrell,
Jeremy Lowery, Jason Lowery, Taylor Sullivan and Michael Lamb while they were in
high school. They started as a cover band called Bailey Drive where they
started writing songs for A Not So Tragic Cover Up. After the
release of this EP they signed with Mono Vs. Stereo Records and
then released their first full-length album titled I Call This Abandonment in 2005 and their second album Fiends in 2007.[1]  On
September 24, 2007 the band announced they had broken up through their
Myspace blog.[2] In 2008 the band played a few shows during the
summer, but never fully reunited. In 2010, Jason, Adam, and Jeremy
announced the formation of a new band called Astoria and released a 6-song EP called [E.P.(ic) - EP].
In January 2014, vocalist Adam Harrell announced that he and his wife were planning on adopting a child and that Chasing Victory would be reuniting for one show in the near future to help raise money for the adoption. The show was a success and the Harrells adopted their new daughter shortly after. 
In 2016, the band announced their reformation with the release of a new song entitled "She Haunts Me" on Halloween day, and the band played several shows throughout the Southeast US in the summer of 2017. 
The band released a new 4-song independent EP entitled "Friends, Volume 1" in early 2018.
