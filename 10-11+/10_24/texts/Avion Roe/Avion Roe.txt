Avion Roe formed in 2011 by frontman Evan Couture and drummer Josh Cutlip after the disbanding of Red Car Wire (Universal Records) which they were in together. After adding their friends Sean Humphrey and Jordan Modro to the mix, the band knew this was the final lineup. Here on January 4, 2011 in Dallas, Texas, Avion Roe was formed.
Our band started on Jan 4th, 2011. We had thought we would be a five piece band but when we flew Jordan down to try out we knew we had it. We were immediately four brothers. We released our full length record in spring and jumped on the Vans Warped Tour. We shot a music video for our first single ‘Who I Am…’ and then jumped on a national tour with Madina Lake and Me Talk Pretty. We have had two songs on MTV and are shooting our second music video next week. This band is only beginning to unfold.[1]
