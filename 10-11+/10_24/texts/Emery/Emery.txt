Emery is an American post-hardcore band from Seattle, Washington currently signed to BadChristian Music. Emery was founded in Rock Hill, South Carolina by Toby Morrell, Devin Shelton, Matt Carter, Josh Head, Joel Green and Seth Studley, and moved to Seattle in order to reach a more music centered scene.
Before signing with Tooth & Nail Records, Emery recorded two EPs, The Columbus EEP Thee and The Weak's End demo that they used to attract attention from labels. With Tooth & Nail, they have recorded five studio albums, and two EPs. The Weak's End, their debut album, was released in 2004, followed by The Question in 2005 and I'm Only A Man in 2007. The latter fulfilled Emery's contract with Tooth & Nail. However, the band re-signed with the label and released ...In Shallow Seas We Sail on June 2, 2009 and We Do What We Want on March 29, 2011. After signing with BadChristian Music the band released You Were Never Alone on May 19, 2015, and Eve on November 9, 2018.
Emery formed in 2001 in Rock Hill, South Carolina but moved to Seattle, Washington in search of a better musical environment. The band was named after a first grader that Toby Morrell met while working as an intern for a teacher in college. The four members in the band at the time, Toby Morrell (vocals/guitar), Devin Shelton (drums), Matt Carter (guitar/keyboards), and Joel "Chopper" Green (bass) left Rock Hill, South Carolina for Seattle on September 11, the day of the terrorist attacks; they found out about the attacks when they stopped at a local diner in South Carolina. Most of the members are from the bands Sachul, Joe 747, Simply Waynes and Oogie Brown.[citation needed] After a little while Seth Studley, who was one of the original members of the band, broke out of a serious relationship and followed them to Seattle and resumed his post as drummer. Because Seth took over drums, Devin took the position of guitarist.
After making Emerald City their new home in Seattle, Washington, Emery signed a record deal with Tooth & Nail Records, also of Seattle, in 2002.[6] Wasting no time, Emery paired up with producer/engineer Ed Rose and worked on their debut album, The Weak's End. It was produced at the Black Lodge Studio in Eudora, Kansas.[7] The record was released in January 2004 by Tooth & Nail Records. Emery toured extensively to promote their new release.
While touring, Seth Studley decided to leave the band in order to get married and Emery had to look for a new drummer.[8] While touring with Haste the Day, Dave Powell was brought out to audition. Powell was officially put in the band in November 2005. Powell originally played in the Indianapolis-based metalcore/hardcore band The Bowels of Judas.
Soon after touring, Emery went back into the studio to record their next record with production done by Aaron Sprinkle this time around. The band took five weeks in recording sessions. The Question was released on August 2, 2005. "Studying Politics" was released as the album's first single with a video emerging on June 29, 2005.[9] On November 21, 2006, Emery re-released The Question, adding a DVD, five acoustic versions of previously recorded songs and two new demo tracks, which were produced by Matt Carter. The DVD included a documentary film of Emery, live songs and bonus footage.
After the re-release, Joel "Chopper" Green decided to leave the band. On September 19, 2006, Emery posted a blog on their website explaining the departure.[10][11][12] Devin and Toby have now switched bass parts in concerts and in the studio.
While touring with Underoath in Australia, Emery announced that they were releasing a new album, I'm Only a Man, which leaked onto the internet before its official release on October 2, 2007. It was produced by Ryan Boesch and Matt Carter and recorded at Dark Horse Recording Studio in Tennessee. It received mixed reviews. Emery released a deluxe edition of the album as well, which featured four acoustic songs that were recorded while on the Take Action Tour with The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus and DVD with live footage and a documentary. The iTunes version of the deluxe edition also added a bonus track called "Whoa! Man".
Emery announced in an interview on TVU that they finished a new 8-track EP entitled While Broken Hearts Prevail, which was released on October 28, 2008. They began premiering some of the new material while on tour opening for The Almost, including "Edge of the World. "
In an interview with Toby Morrell, Emery announced that they would be releasing a new album called ...In Shallow Seas We Sail.

On January 31, 2011, vocalist, rhythm guitarist, and bassist Devin Shelton announced he was taking an "indefinite hiatus" from Emery.
I just wanted to let you all know that I am taking an indefinite hiatus from Emery. This has been a very tough decision for me, since Emery has been an important part of my life for over a decade. I'm not saying I will never do anything else with Emery, but things change and life goes on, no matter how much I will miss it. Thanks so much for all your support over the years and I hope everyone continues to follow Emery all the same.On February 1, 2011, a song titled "The Cheval Glass" was released on the band's Facebook, YouTube and Myspace page.[20] On February 17, 2011, the band announced that We Do What We Want would be released through both Tooth & Nail and their hardcore/metal subdivision Solid State Records reflecting the heavier sound of the album. "Lyrically I think this is our most personal, spiritual album. It talks about our faith and God, but it never gets too preachy, because it's basically talking about me and things I've gone through, " shares Morrell. "I can't not tell the truth of who I am, and this time I explored that even further—just points in my life, or in the other guys' lives. Some lyrics are about challenging authority and God, and is God real, and what that even means. " [21]
Emery headlined the "Do What You Want" tour alongside the bands To Speak of Wolves, and Hawkboy (formerly As Cities Burn).[22] While on tour, the band has announced that they would be coming out with an acoustic album.[23] On March 28, 2011, Emery released a stream of their new album We Do What We Want on AOL.com.[24]
