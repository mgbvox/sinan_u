Native Nod was a groundbreaking emotive hardcore band formed in the early '90s based in the New York / New Jersey area where the group would often play shows. The band is often credited with giving rise to the emo scene, and at very young ages (high school). In their short lifetime as a band they only released 9 songs, divided amongst the 3 seven inch EPs Bread, Answers, and Lower GI Bleed. These 9 songs can be found on the Gern Blandsten Records discography Today Puberty, Tomorrow The World.
