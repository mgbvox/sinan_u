Falling in Reverse is an American rock band based in Las Vegas, Nevada and formed in 2008,[1] signed to Epitaph Records.
The band is led currently by vocalist Ronnie Radke, alongside rhythm guitarist Derek Jones, keyboardist/guitarist Zakk Sandler, bassist Tyler Burgess and lead guitarist Max Georgiev. The group released its debut album, The Drug in Me Is You, on July 26, 2011, which peaked at No. 19 on the Billboard 200, selling 18,000 copies in its first week. The band's second studio album, Fashionably Late, was released on June 18, 2013, which peaked at No. 17 on the Billboard 200.[2] The band released their third album Just Like You on February 24, 2015. Coming Home, their latest album, was released on April 7, 2017.
The band has toured extensively in support of its releases with other musical groups such as Escape the Fate, Chelsea Grin, Atreyu, Attila, Metro Station, letlive., I See Stars, among several others.
In 2008, lead singer Ronnie Radke was involved in an altercation in Las Vegas that resulted in the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Cook. While Radke did not shoot Cook, he was indicted on battery charges. These charges, combined with Radke's past troubles with narcotics and rehab, led to a suspended sentence and five years probation. After he failed to report to his probation officer he was arrested in June 2008, where his probation was revoked and he was mandated to serve his original sentence of two years in prison.[3][4] At the time, Ronnie Radke was the lead singer of post-hardcore band Escape the Fate, which in 2006, released its debut album, Dying Is Your Latest Fashion. Following Radke's incarceration, he was ejected from the band and replaced by former Blessthefall lead singer Craig Mabbitt.[5] Max Green, bassist of Escape the Fate, stated about Radke's law problems that, "First we couldn't tour out of the country, then out of the state."[citation needed] Radke was released on December 12, 2010.[citation needed]
Radke discussed his relationship with Escape the Fate members since his departure from the band, stating that they have tried to reconcile with Radke but he was uninterested in getting back on friendly terms with them after they kicked him out and misinformed their fans about Radke getting caught with heroin inside prison. Radke stated in an interview, "They make a whole album called This War Is Ours, and then they try to say, 'We didn't name that album after you, dude.' Which in fact, they did. I could be wrong; they could be talking about the war on terrorism or something. I don't know. But I just have a feeling that record name was about me. They talk a lot of shit. It is always about forgive and forget, but there's some things that I would like to say. So I did. On the record."[6]
During his time in prison, Radke formed a new band called From Behind These Walls.  He officially began creating media with the band upon his release, but was later forced to change its name to Falling in Reverse due to copyright infringement. In 2009, with Radke still in prison, he was able to launch a demo of his band, due to contacts with several musicians he had. The demo contains four songs that were not put on the debut album The Drug in Me Is You.[7] The original lineup consisted of Radke and bassist Nason Schoeffler, who helped find guitarist Jacky Vincent and rhythm guitarist Derek Jones. The band went through several drummers. Nick Rich was later replaced by Oscar Garcia, Khaled Biersack,[8][9] and former LoveHateHero member Scott Gee, as official members,[10] before finding former the Bigger Lights drummer Ryan Seaman.[3][11][12] Schoeffler quit the band in April 2011[13] and was replaced by Mika Horiuchi, formerly of the band Cellador, who also later departed from the band after issues with Radke.[14]
In January 2010, the band began recording for the first time. The group announced on December 20 that it would go to Orlando, Florida to record a full-length debut album over a period of two months with a tentative release date of the first quarter of 2011. The band also confirmed that Radke's friend, Michael Baskette, who has worked on Blessthefall's album Witness and Radke on Escape the Fate's debut Dying Is Your Latest Fashion, would produce the album.[15] It was soon confirmed that the band was signed with Epitaph Records, Radke's former label with Escape the Fate, and the band released its debut album in 2011.[16] The album was soon titled The Drug in Me Is You and was slated for a July 26, 2011 release date, with pre-orders beginning on June 7.[12] The eleven song track list was released soon after. With the help of Executive Producer Michael "Elvis" Baskette, mixing and tracking for the album concluded on April 2, 2011.[17] The album spawned the singles "Raised by Wolves"[18][19][20] and "The Drug in Me Is You".[21][22][23] The band's first music video was released for "The Drug in Me Is You" on June 28, 2011,[22][24] and was advertised by The New York Post the week before the album's release.[25] The album was streamed via the band's website on July 15.[26] The Drug in Me Is You was released in the United States on July 26, 2011[27][28] to mostly mixed reviews,[29][30][31] but managed to sell 18,000 copies in its first week in the US charting at number 19 on the Billboard 200.[32][33] A third single, "I'm Not a Vampire", was released a few months after the album's release on October 24 with an accompanying music video featuring Jeffree Star which features a satirical Celebrity Rehab theme,[34] and reached over one million views in three days.[35]
The songs for the debut album were all written by Radke during his imprisonment. Lead vocalist Ronnie Radke has often called the album a breakup record, but with a band and not a girl.[36] Radke said that, "I would think all day, for days and days, [about] what people would want to hear. I would dissect my old album and read all the fan letters and the reasons why they loved my band and why they listened to it. And I wrote about that, but in different ways. I don't know why these kids love the tragedies that I write about. I guess they can relate to it."[6]
To promote the album, the band announced the dates for its first live performances, which took place at the end of July following the album's release at certain locations in California, with one date scheduled in Texas on September 24, 2011. These shows were planned to be with supporting act Vampires Everywhere!.[37] The July dates were postponed due to issues with guitarist Jacky Vincent's immigration visa, though the band voiced intentions to make these dates up.[38] This meant that the band's first live performances would be at the Vans Warped Tour 2011 from August 10 to 14 for five shows on the Kia Kevin Says Stage throughout the western United States.[37] The band played a few secret shows under the name "Goodbye Graceful" on August eighth and ninth in Anaheim and Los Angeles.[39]
Following the release of the album and some Warped Tour 2011 appearances, the band announced its first headlining tour across the United States, with locations beginning in New Mexico, looping around the east coast, and concluding in Colorado. The tour took place from September to October 2011 with support acts Eyes Set to Kill and For All Those Sleeping.[40][41] The band's first supporting tour was to be a ten-show tour in November 2011 with headliners Black Veil Brides and supporting acts Aiden and Drive-A,[42] but was canceled after Black Veil Brides dropped out when their lead vocalist Andy Biersack broke his nose.[43] Emmure replaced Falling in Reverse on the second half of the Take A Picture, It Lasts Longer Tour with We Came As Romans[44] and the band played an exclusive show at KROQ on November 8 to make up for the canceled shows.[45]
The bands started out its first headlining tour, The Drug in Me Is You Tour, in February 2012 was with support from Skip the Foreplay and Oh, Sleeper. In January 2012, the band announced Mika Horiuchi's departure from the band, Falling in Reverse's frontman Ronnie Radke gave Altpress.com this exclusive statement regarding Horiuchi's departure from the band "Mika is not in the band and that's it. Nothing more to say right now but stay tuned kids, 2012 is our year."[46] In January 2012, former I Am Ghost bassist Ron Ficarro began filling in as Falling in Reverse's The Drug in Me Is You Tour touring bassist due to the departure of former bassist Mika Horiuchi.[47] Later on Ronnie announced on stage that Ron Ficarro was replacing Mika permanently. On February 6, 2012, former Escape the Fate member, Omar Espinosa made a guest appearance on stage performing "Situations" and "Not Good Enough for Truth In Clich√©" (Although this could have been because Derek wasn't there). The band's third music video for its debut album's first single, "Raised by Wolves", was released on February 28, 2012.
In late August Falling in Reverse announced a Fall/Winter headlining tour called "The Thug in Me is You Tour" with supporting acts Enter Shikari, I See Stars, Matt Toka and letlive.[citation needed]
Vocalist Ronnie Radke had been hinting on Twitter that the group had been working on the band's second album, with tweets such as "You guys don't understand how many light years my next album is from the last one". He and bandmate Ron Ficarro tweeted pictures of them in the studio with Ryan Ogren working on some new music. Ronnie had said a little bit about the new album to Marshal Music News. He said that, "The last record was so vengeful and bitter and spiteful - so everyone is wondering what I'm gonna sing about next. And I'm just not quite ready to let people know. I'm sorry. When people hear the new stuff though I promise you they will lose their mind. It's light years ahead of my last album. We're demoing new songs right now, as we speak, and I'm telling you, people are seriously gonna lose their mind." During the band's performance at Dirt Fest 2012 in Birch Run Michigan, Radke announced to the crowd that it would be the group's last show before returning to the studio for the band's second album. Ronnie also said in an interview that the band would be in the studio late 2012 with demos already and hoping for an early 2013 release. In issue number 1442 of Kerrang! Magazine, Ronnie Radke announced in an interview that "The record's finished! That's what we did after the Warped Tour. We just didn't tell anybody!" He also said "[it will be released] early next year [summer 2013]!"
On May 7 the band released the first single and music video, "Alone", from the second album, titled, Fashionably Late. The cover, merchandise, and a June 18, 2013 release date was revealed on May 7 as well.[48][49]

On May 13 Falling in Reverse announced on Twitter the band had cancelled tour dates due to lead singer Radke was expecting the birth of his first child with his fianc√© Crissy Henderson. Falling in Reverse officially stated on Facebook "Our apologies but Falling in Reverse has to cancel the rest of the dates scheduled in May.

See you soon."[50] The band also canceled the dates to play Warped Tour.

In March 2014, Radke announced that the band had begun recording its third album. On May 12, 2014, it was announced by Alternative Press that Falling in Reverse had parted ways with bassist Ron Ficarro, reporting that former Escape the Fate bassist Max Green (who announced his departure from Escape the Fate just 3 days before on May 9, six months after rejoining Escape the Fate[56]) would be his replacement. Ronnie is quoted as saying "Ron was probably the best bass player I've ever played with, but at this moment in time I feel it is best to part ways with him. I respect him and wish nothing but the best for him. Max quitting Escape The Fate was like a godsend. It was a no brainer to have him join. I've known him half my life and this will be a great new chapter to start.  "[57]
In an interview with MTV, Radke stated that the next album would be nothing like the single Alone from Fashionably Late as it has no raps throughout the album; he stated that it is heavier and will contain more screams, moving his passion for rapping into his solo career.[58] Radke explained in another interview that the third album will be more like a "sequel" to the Escape the Fate album Dying Is Your Latest Fashion and is aimed to be nostalgic to people who were fans of the band since then.[59]
In August it was announced that the band will be supporting Black Veil Brides on their headline tour across America throughout October and November dubbed "The Black Mass" and will also be supported by Set It Off and Drama Club.[60] On October 6, 2014, a month before the Black Mass tour started, it was announced that Max Green had left the band due to personal issues unrelated to the band.

On January 6, 2016, the band members announced that they had begun work on their next album stating that it would be "It's a huge left turn. It sounds like nothing we‚Äôve ever done. Every song is very vibey, There's more feeling in it instead of a lot of metal.", further stating that
"We‚Äôre challenging ourselves now more than we ever have in the weirdest ways possible because you would think writing the craziest solo or riffs would be the challenging part. But the challenging part is trying to stick to a theme and not go all over the place like we would normally do." The album is expected later this year through Epitaph Records.[67][68] On December 19, the band officially released the first single "Coming Home" from the untitled album.[69] In January 2017, Radke began performing guitar for the band. On January 20, 2017, the band announced their next album Coming Home, which was released on April 7. Around the time of its release, it was rumoured that drummer Ryan Seaman parted ways with the band.[70][71] This was confirmed when the band performed on May 8, without Seaman with Chris Kamrada playing drums as a touring member, who since left to play for Dashboard Confessional.[citation needed]

On June 26, 2018, the band released a song called, Losing My Life along with a music video as a continuation of where the music video for Losing My Mind ended and featured a new line-up for the band which consists of Tyler Burgess on bass, Max Georgiev as lead guitarist, drummer Brandon "Rage" Richter, and Zakk Sandler on keyboards and rhythm guitar.[73] The band also announced that they will be performing selected dates at the final year of the annual Vans Warped Tour with the new line up.[74] Shortly after the Warped Tour the band announced an acoustic tour called "The Roast of Ronnie Radke". Brandon Richter silently left the band shortly before the tour. In the middle of the tour the band canceled the tour due to a personal family matter.
On April 8, 2019, a new music video for the song "Drugs" was released. Zakk Sandler was not included in the video. The video features Christian "CC" Coma playing drums and guest vocals from Slipknot and Stone Sour frontman Corey Taylor.[75] Ronnie spoke on Twitter about Zakk Sandler saying: "We all love Zakk, one of my favorite people ever but he wants to focus on home life with his family and business he runs at the moment, it does not mean he will not be touring with us next tour", confirming that he is still a member of the band.[76]
Falling in Reverse has been categorized as post-hardcore,[77][78][79][80][81] metalcore,[82][83] hard rock,[84][85] pop punk,[79][86] glam metal,[79] hip hop,[87] rapcore,[citation needed] electronica,[87] and rap metal.[88] Falling in Reverse's sound has at times also been described as emo with pop-stylized choruses and a blend between pop and metalcore.[89] The band's second album, Fashionably Late, included hip hop and electronic elements with the addition of rapping.[80][90]
Radke commented that "in the same songs it sounds like Norma Jean or Underoath with Katy Perry choruses."[91] According to Radke some of the band's lyrical tones are, "arrogant, [it's something] like rappers do mostly." This is because Radke has cited Eminem as one of his major influences,[92] so much so that he even included a beat made by Eminem and Dr. Dre during a breakdown on the track "Sink or Swim".[91] Radke also cites Blink-182 and Beastie Boys as an influence for the band's pop punk and hip hop sounds, respectively.[citation needed]
The lyrical content of the band's music is inspired mainly by vocalist Radke's personal experiences, which include his mother, the corruption of Las Vegas, and his incarceration/release from prison due to multiple run-ins with the law involving narcotics and battery charges related to the death of Michael Cook. No songs by the band to date concern love because Radke stated that, "...I'm not going to lie ... and try to write songs on how much I love somebody. I do have love, but there will be a lot of songs about just what I've been through."[93] Several songs focused on his departure from Escape the Fate after the group kicked him out and replaced him with former Blessthefall singer Craig Mabbitt,[5] with songs by the band that directly attacked both Mabbitt and Escape the Fate's bassist Max Green.[93]
