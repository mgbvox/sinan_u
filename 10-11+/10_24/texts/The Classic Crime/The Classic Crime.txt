Some fans have assumed that the Classic Crime is a Christian band due to being signed on to Tooth & Nail Records. Also adding to the confusion is that many music stores and online sales list the Classic Crime as a Christian band for the same reason. This is true of iTunes Store. Also, all four of the Classic Crime's full-length albums have charted on Billboard Music's Top Christian Albums music chart.[10] However, the Classic Crime does not label themselves a "Christian" band. As Matt writes on TCC's discussion board, "We believe faith is personal, and can be only held by an individual person. To entitle a group 'Christian' would be to assume that the group has a collective soul, or at least individual souls tied to a solid collective belief. Not everyone in our band is decidedly set in their faith, and we respect that."[11]
