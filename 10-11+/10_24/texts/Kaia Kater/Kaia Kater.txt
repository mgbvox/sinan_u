Kaia Kater (b. Montreal, age 26)[1][2] is a Canadian singer-songwriter, guitar, piano and banjo player. 
Kater was born in Montreal, where she spent her early childhood in Mile End.[2]   She also lived in Wakefield, Ottawa and Winnipeg before attending Davis & Elkins college in Elkins, West Virginia on a banjo scholarship.[3][4] In Elkins, she also learned to flatfoot and deepened her knowledge of body percussion (hambone).[4] Her mother is from Quebec, and her father immigrated to Canada from Grenada as a teenager.
She grew up spending significant time in the North American folk music community, attending festivals, camps and conferences frequently during her teen years.[5]
She released her first EP Old Soul in 2012, and her first full-length album Sorrow Bound in 2014.[6]
In 2016, she won the "Pushing the Boundaries" award at the 12th Canadian Folk Music Awards for her third album, Nine Pin.[7] The Guardian reviewed it as "tremendous" with four stars out of five.[8] Rolling Stone noted Kater's mixture of traditional banjo playing and "sobering, honest lyrics exploring all-too-current themes including poverty and racism...a quiet, yet powerful storm", naming her a "need to know" artist of 2016.[1]
In 2017 and 2018, Kater toured extensively, performing at venues and festivals throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and the United Kingdom, including a performance at the Kennedy Center, at the invitation of the Grammy Museum as part of a tribute to Pete Seeger.[9] She performed at the 2018 Newport Folk Festival, with Rolling Stone highlighting her performance as one of the '12 Best Things We Saw' [10] and Carnegie Hall announced her performance as part of Migrations: The Making of America in their 2018-2019 season.[11]
Kater's 2018 album, Grenades, explores her personal history, including the story of her father's childhood and journey to Canada.[12]
While influenced by folk music, Kater cites Nina Simone, Erykah Badu and Lauryn Hill as important voices in shaping the direction of her artistic, social and political expression.[13]
